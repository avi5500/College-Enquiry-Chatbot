# College-Enquiry-Chatbot
The College Enquiry Chatbot is an interactive conversational AI system designed to assist prospective students and individuals seeking information about a college or university. This intelligent chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for answering queries related to admission requirements, courses offered, application processes, and more.

Powered by natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies, the chatbot can understand and interpret user inputs to accurately predict their intents. It employs a feedforward neural network with an LSTM layer for intent classification, enabling it to handle a diverse range of user queries.

The chatbot is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing labeled intents and their corresponding responses. Through the use of Flask, it is transformed into a web application, allowing users to access its services through a browser.
